# 📜 License Recommendation Analysis for Seed Card

## Why MIT License is Recommended

### **🎯 Perfect Fit for Seed Card**

**MIT License** is ideal for the Seed Card project because:

1. **🔓 Maximum Adoption**
   - Permissive license encourages widespread use
   - Security tools benefit from broad adoption and review
   - No restrictions on commercial or non-commercial use

2. **🛡️ Security Through Transparency**
   - Allows anyone to audit the cryptographic implementation
   - Security researchers can freely examine and improve the code
   - Forks and modifications help identify potential issues

3. **🔧 Integration Friendly**
   - Can be embedded in proprietary password managers
   - Compatible with corporate security tooling
   - No copyleft restrictions that might limit adoption

4. **📚 Educational Use**
   - Universities can use it in cryptography courses
   - Students can learn from real-world implementation
   - No licensing barriers for academic research

### **Alternative Licenses Considered**

**Apache 2.0**: 
- ✅ Good patent protection
- ❌ More complex (longer license text)
- ❌ Overkill for this project size

**GPL v3**:
- ✅ Ensures derivatives remain open source
- ❌ May limit adoption in commercial environments
- ❌ Security tools need wide adoption more than copyleft

**BSD 3-Clause**:
- ✅ Similar to MIT
- ❌ Slightly more restrictions (advertising clause)
